This is my first post on my new blog!

Okay, so I started this blog to explain the concept of some technologies so that it would be easier for anyone to to delve into them and start using them.  

Consider this my own little way of giving back. I've benefitted a lot from the community, so I'm using this blog to help others who might just be coming in to software engineering.

I'm gonna try as much as possible to relate them to real life, to things that we're already used to, cos i've discovered that most of these terms almost always have bearings with things we see and interact with everyday.

So let's get right to it, shall we? Check out my next post for the first term i'm gonna "uncomplexify" (I don't think thats a word, but you get the message, right?)
