Yes, I know. All these technologies. They can be a little overwhelming. I know I said we need servers in our lives and now, I’m talking about serverless. 

Well, one thing I can say is this, In the tech world, don’t be too quick to judge a technology by its name 😉.

Now, serverless or serverless architecture does not mean the absence of servers. 

Let’s build on our fancy restaurant illustration we used [ <span style="color:#e7a020">here</span> ](/we-need-servers-in-our-lives/).

Say you decide to throw a party. You have a couple of options.

**Option 1: Throw the party at your house**

But you’ll have to arrange everything! Food, drinks, music, and more importantly, you need to arrange how the food and drinks would be **served!** You might need to arrange for some extra help. Even if you tell your friends to help, you’ll still need to coordinate everything! And hey, what if more people come and the servers (your friends) can’t meet up with the traffic? Uh-oh! You’ll need to start running around and arranging for more servers. At the end of the day, you might not enjoy your party! Sad!


The ‘party’ is the app you want to deploy to the public, including your friends. We learnt [ <span style="color:#e7a020">here</span> ](/we-need-servers-in-our-lives/) that when you make a request on your browser or your mobile app, someone or something has to answer. A server! Now you’ve built your app and you want the world to start using it. You need servers.

If you decide to personally manage the servers (throw the party in your house) you’ll have a lot to manage. What if the servers you setup become overwhelmed cos of a lot of traffic? You’ll have to start getting more servers or scaling your servers to meet up with demand and you need to monitor all of them to make sure they don’t get tired (overwhelmed) to the point where they can’t take any more requests. 

This is a lot of work actually.


**Option 2: Throw the party at the fancy restaurant (Serverless)**

What if you didn’t have to worry about all of those? Well, that’s what serverless is all about. 

So the fancy restaurant (serverless provider) takes care of everything, food, drinks, **servers!** Everything! All you need to do is get your friends to gather at the location and everything will be taken care of. 

What if there are more friends than you anticipated?

The fancy restaurant or serverless provider automatically scales the servers to meet the demand. So you ain’t gotta worry about all of that.


You just need to focus on your party (building your app).

Did I also mention that with serverless, you only pay for what you use? Yup, you only pay for what you use.

So serverless architecture or serverless computing or severless for short dosen't mean there won't be servers. We still need servers!😁

There are many serverless providers(fancy restaurants) out there, here are a few: 

<a style="color:#e79e1b" href="https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/" target="_blank">AWS</a>

<a style="color:#e79e1b" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/serverless" target="_blank">Microsoft's Azure Serverless</a>

<a style="color:#e79e1b" href="https://cloud.google.com/serverless" target="_blank">Google Cloud's serverless</a>


I think it's also important to mention that there's no best option. It depends on some factors including the kind of party(app) you're throwing (deploying).
