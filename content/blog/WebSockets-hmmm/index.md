This is my first post on my new blog!

Okay, so I started this blog to breakdown technical terms. In all my years in the industry, I've discovered that if you understand the reason behind a technology, it becomes easy to start using it since you know the problem it's supposed to solve.

I've benefitted a lot from the community. I intend to use this blog to help others who might just be coming in to software engineering.

I'm gonna try as much as possible to relate them to real life, to things that we're already used to, cos i've discovered that most of these technologies almost always have connections to things we see and interact with everyday.

So let's get right to it, shall we? Check out my next post for the first term i'm gonna "uncomplexify" (I don't think thats a word, but you get the message, right?ðŸ˜‰ðŸ™‚)
